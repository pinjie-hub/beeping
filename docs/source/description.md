##### **Beeping** is a technology that enables your Apps to send and receive information **over ultrasounds**. We call this ultrasound **Beep**.

A **Beep** is an audio file that, when reproduced, emits a non-audible signal to humans. This audio has data embeded, and that data can be sent through any device that has a speaker.

To decode the content of this audio we need a device that has a microphone - **such as a Smartphone** - and integrate the appropriate **SDK** for each type of platform.

> **Beeping** is a technology that has been tested in different parts of the world in different stages, such as discos, pubs, live concerts and soccer stadiums: as in **Sánchez Pizjuán** in Sevilla or in the **Boca Juniors** stadium in Buenos Aires.

**Beeping** has been designed to be another communication option that offers us very powerful advantages. Establish communications without the need to have Internet, or send and receive digital content in real time.
